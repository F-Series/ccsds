/**
 * The modular checksum (identified by checksum type zero) shall be calculated by the
 * following method (see annex F for an example):
 * a) the checksum shall initially be set to all 'zeroes';
 * b) it shall be calculated by modulo 2^32 addition of all 4-octet words, aligned from the
 * start of the file;
 * c) each 4-octet word shall be constructed by copying some octet of file data, whose
 * offset within the file is an integral multiple of 4 (such as 0, 4, 8, 12, etc.), into the first
 * (high-order) octet of the word and copying the next three octets of file data into the
 * next three octets of the word;
 * d) the results of the addition shall be carried into each available octet of the checksum
 * unless the addition overflows the checksum length, in which case, carry shall be
 * discarded.
 *
 * In order to include in a checksum the content of a file-data PDU whose offset
 * is not an integral multiple of 4, it is necessary to align the data properly before
 * adding 4-octet blocks of it to the checksum. Data at offset Q may be aligned
 * by inserting N octets of value 'zero' before the first octet of the data, where
 * N = Q mod 4 (the remainder obtained upon dividing Q by 4).
 *
 * In order to include in a checksum a sequence of M octets (the first of which is
 * at a file offset that is an integral multiple of 4) where M is less than 4, it is
 * necessary to pad the data to length 4 before adding it to the checksum. The
 * data may be padded by inserting (4 â€“ M) octets of value 'zero' after the last
 * octet of the data. This condition can apply only at the end of the file.
