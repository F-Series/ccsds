/**
 * The Resume.request primitive shall be used to request that a suspended transaction be
 * resumed.
 *
 * Resume.request is generated by any CFDP user at any time during the lifetime of any
 * transaction, except in the case of a transaction sent in unacknowledged mode, for which it
 * can only be generated by the transaction’s source user.
 *
 * Receipt of Resume.request shall have no effect on any transaction that is not currently
 * suspended. For a transaction that is currently suspended, it shall cause the local CFDP entity
 * to initiate Resume procedures.
 *
 * User application developers may find it advisable to provide automated support for one
 * special case of transaction resumption, which applies to any transaction the user application
 * can determine is currently suspended solely due to transaction inactivity (i.e., as a result of
 * an Inactivity fault). On receipt of any service indication produced because of arrival of a
 * PDU for such a transaction, the user application might infer that the transaction’s inactivity is
 * ended and thereupon automatically resume the transaction.
