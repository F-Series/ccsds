eu.dariolucia.ccsds.tmtc contains a modified version of the Reed Solomon code
from Project Nayuki (https://www.nayuki.io).

Copyright (c) 2017 Project Nayuki

The rights to use Nayuki's code for the CCSDS TM/TC project released under the
Apache License 2.0 have been granted.

Original Nayuki's code has been modified in the following way:
- removed the error correction capabilities (and related code)
- added the support for the specification of the initial root when computing
  the generator polynomial
- moved the specification of the binary field as inner class
- replaced the type Integer with byte on public operations, in order to
  simplify the handling of byte arrays from external callers
- moved the computation of the generator polynomial inside the constructor

The modified code is located inside class eu.dariolucia.ccsds.tmtc.algorithm.rs.ReedSolomon.
